# Authentication and Authorization

This is how MSS authenticates its users and controls their access to the quantum computer resource.

## Authentication

- It uses [Oauth2](https://oauth.net/2/), a standard similar to HTTP in the sense that for any system,
  also called an **Oauth2 client**, to allow its users to authenticate with another system,
  called an **Oauth2 provider**, all that is needed are two strings:
  - `CLIENT_ID`
  - `CLIENT_SECRET`
- The two strings are unique to this system, but are given by the Oauth2 provider
- Common Oauth2 providers include Google, Github, Microsoft, Chalmers (which uses Microsoft)
- Organizations which have a sort of ActiveDirectory can automatically be Oauth2 providers.
- We also use [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) which is a flavour of Oauth2 that requires a third string, a  
  `OPENID_CONFIGURATION_ENDPOINT`, from where to get the configuration of the openID provider.

### How to Set Up a New Oauth2 Provider

- Let's say we want some 'Company B' users to have access to MSS.
- Copy the `mss-config.example.toml` to `mss-config.toml`, and update the configs therein.  
  Note: You could also create a new toml file based on `mss-config.example.toml`  
  and set the `MSS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to point to that file.
- Add the new client:

```toml
[[auth.clients]]
# this name will appear in the URLs e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8002/auth/company-b/...
name = "company-b"
client_id = "some-openid-client-id"
client_secret = "some-openid-client-secret"
# the URL to redirect to after user authenticates with the system.
# It is of the format {MSS_BASE_URL}/auth/{provider_name}/callback
redirect_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8002/auth/company-b/callback"
client_type = "openid"
email_regex = ".*"
# Roles that are automatically given to users who authenticate through Company B
# roles can be: "admin", "user", "researcher", "partner". Default is "user".
roles = ["partner", "user"]
# openid_configuration_endpoint is necessary if Company B uses OpenID Connect, otherwise ignore.
openid_configuration_endpoint = "https://proxy.acc.puhuri.eduteams.org/.well-known/openid-configuration"
```

- Start the frontend.
  Instructions are on the [tergite-frontend/README.md](../../../README.md)

## Authorization

- We control access to MSS, and its BCCs using two ways
  - `roles` control basic access to auth-related endpoints e.g. project creation, token management etc.
  - `projects` control access to all other endpoints. To create a job, or get its results etc,
    one must be attached to a project that has more than zero QPU seconds.
- QPU seconds are the number of seconds a project's experiments are allocated on the quantum computer.
- QPU seconds can be increased, decreased etc., but no job can be created without positive QPU seconds.
- A job could run for longer than the allocated project QPU seconds but
  it may fail to update MSS of its results. A user must thus make sure their project has enough QPU seconds.

### How Authorization Works

Here is an interaction diagram of QAL9000 auth showcasing authentication via [MyAccessID](https://ds.myaccessid.org/).

### FAQs

#### - How do we bypass authentication in development?

We use feature flag `auth.is_enabled` property in the `mss-config.toml` file, setting it to `false`

```toml
is_enabled = false
```

**Note: Most endpoints will still require authentication because they depend on the current user**

#### - How do we ensure that in production, authentication is always turned on?

On startup, we raise a ValueError when `auth.is_enabled = false` in the `mss-config.toml` file yet  
config variable `environment = production` and log it.

#### - How do we allow other Tergite components (e.g. tergite backend) to access MSS, without user intervention?

Use app tokens created by any user who had the 'system' role. These app (API) token are created in the tergite dashboard.
Any such token is saved in the `MSS_TOKEN` environment variable in the backend's `.env` file.
The advantage of using app tokens is that they are more secure because they can easily be revoked and scoped.
Since they won't be used to run jobs, their project QPU seconds are expected not to run out.

If you are in development mode, you can just switch off authentication altogether.

**Note: One must set the `MSS_TOKEN` environment variable in Tergite backend or else it will not be able to communicate with the Tergite frontend**

#### - What happens when the `MSS_TOKEN` in Tergite backend or the project it belongs to expires or is deleted.

Unfortunately, currently, the backend will fail with 'Unauthorized' errors in its logs when it attempts to send results to MSS.
The admin must therefore find a way of keeping the `MSS_TOKEN` active.

#### - How do I log in?

- You need to run both [MSS](../) and the [dashboard](../../tergite-dashboard/).
- **Make sure that your `mss-config.toml` files have all variables filled appropriately** for example, both applications should have the same `jwt_secret`.
- The dashboard, when running will redirect you to the login page if you are not already logged in.
- However, you can also log in without running the dashboard first. See the next FAQ.

#### - How do I log in without having to run the dashboard?

- **Make sure that your `mss-config.toml` file has all variables filled appropriately**.
  The `mss-config.example.toml` is a good template to copy from, but it must all placeholder (`<some-stuff>`) must be replaced in the actual `mss-config.toml` file.
- Run the application

```shell
./start_mss.sh
```

- Visit the http://localhost:8002/auth/github/authorize endpoint in your browser if you are running on local host.
- Copy the “authorization_url” from the response and paste it in another tab in your browser. Follow any prompts the browser gives you.
- After you are redirected back to http://localhost:8002/auth/github/callback, you should see an “access_token”. Copy it to your clipboard.  
  If you run into any errors, ensure that the `client_id` and `client_secret` for the `client` table with `name = tergite` in your `mss-config.toml` file are appropriately set.
- You can then try to create an app token or anything auth related using `curl` or [postman](https://www.postman.com/).  
  To authenticate those requests, you must always pass an "Authorization" header of format `Bearer <access_token>`.  
  **Do note that this auth token can only be used on `/auth...` endpoints. It will return 401/403 errors on all other endpoints**.
- Do note also that some endpoints are only accessible to users that have a given role e.g. 'admin' or 'system' etc.

#### - Why do I keep being redirected back to the login page even after successful login?

The likely cause is the `cookie_domain` variable in the `mss_config.toml`. It needs to be the same as the domain you visit the dashboard on in the web browser.  
It also needs to be the same domain that your `MSS_URL` environment variable is in the `.env` file.

**A big culprit is the localhost vs 127.0.0.1. Make sure you use 127.0.0.1 in all both your `.env` and `mss_config.toml`. Visit the browser also at 127.0.0.1:3000**

#### - How does BCC get authenticated?

- A client (say [tergite](https://github.com/tergite/tergite)) sends a `POST`
  request is sent to `/jobs` on MSS (this app) with an `app_token` in its `Authorization` header
- A new job entry is created in the database, together with a new unique `job_id`.
- MSS notifies BCC of the `job_id` and its associated `app_token` by sending a `POST` request to `/auth` endpoint
  of [BCC](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-backend).
- In the response to the client, MSS returns the `/jobs` url for the given BCC backend
- The client then sends its experiment data to the BCC `/jobs` url, with the same `app_token` in
  its `Authorization` header and the same `job_id` in the experiment data.
- BCC checks if the `job_id` and the `app_token` are first of all associated, and if no other experiment data has
  been sent already with the same `job_id`-`app_token` pair. This is to ensure no user attempts to fool the system
  by using the same `job_id` for multiple experiments, which is theoretically possible.
- If BCC is comfortable with the results of the check, it allows the job to be submitted. Otherwise, either a 401
  or a 403 HTTP error is thrown.
- The same `job_id`-`app_token` pair is used to download raw logfiles from BCC at `/logfiles/{job_id}` endpoint.
  This time, BCC just checks that the pair match but it does not check if the pair was used already.
- This is the same behaviour when reading the job results at `jobs/{job_id}/result`
  or the job status at `jobs/{job_id}/status` or the entire job entry at `jobs/{job_id}` in BCC.
- This is also the same behaviour when attempting to delete the job at `/jobs/{job_id}` or to cancel it at
  `/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` in BCC.

**Note: One must set the `MSS_TOKEN` environment variable in Tergite backend or else it will not be able to communicate with the Tergite frontend**

## Puhuri

[Puhuri](https://puhuri.neic.no/) is an HPC resource management platform that could also be used to manage Quantumm Computer systems.

We need to synchronize MSS's resource management with that in Puhuri

The Puhuri Entity Layout
![Puhuri Layout](./assets/puhuri-entity-layout.png)

### Flows

More information about flows can be found in the [puhuri docs folder](puhuri)

![Selecting resource to report on](./assets/puhuri-resource-usage-reporting-flow.png)

### Assumptions

- When creating components in the puhuri UI, the 'measurement unit's
  set on the component are of the following possible values:
  'second', 'hour', 'minute', 'day', 'week', 'half_month', and 'month'.

### How to Start the Puhuri Sync

- Ensure that the `is_enabled = true` in the `[puhuri]` table in your `mss-config.toml` file
- Ensure all other variables in the `[puhuri]` table in your `mss-config.toml` file are appropriately set e.g.

```toml
[puhuri]
# the URI to the Puhuri WALDUR server instance
# Please contact the Puhuri team to get this.
waldur_api_uri = "<the URI to the Puhuri Waldur server>"
# The access token to be used in the Waldur client [https://docs.waldur.com/user-guide/] to connect to Puhuri
# Please contact the Puhuri team on how to get this from the UI
waldur_client_token = "<API token for a puhuri user who has 'service provider manager' role for our offering on puhuri>"
# The unique ID for the service provider associated with this app in the Waldur Puhuri server
# Please contact the Puhuri team on how to get this from the UI
provider_uuid = "<the unique ID for the service provider associated with this app in Puhuri>"
# the interval in seconds at which puhuri is polled. default is 900 (15 minutes)
poll_interval = "<some value>"
```

- If you wish to start only the puhuri synchronization script without the REST API, run in your virtual environment:

```shell
python -m api.scripts.puhuri_sync --ignore-if-disabled
```

- In order to run both the REST API and this puhuri synchronization script, run in your virtual environment:

```shell
python -m api.scripts.puhuri_sync --ignore-if-disabled & \
  uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 api.rest:app  --proxy-headers
```
